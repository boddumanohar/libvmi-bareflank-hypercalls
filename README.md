#### The purpose

On intel based machines, Bareflank can accept hypercalls for userspace. 
The entire architecture of the Libvmi+bareflank is based on this basic
idea. If bareflank every decides to turn of this feature, the entire 
LibVMI+bareflank build breaks. 

These are a custom built apis which are the receiving side for the hypercalls 
generated by the LibVMI. 

#### Basic Working of Hypercall

When the LibVMI gives a hypercall for example say `get_vcpu_id`, there should
be somereceiving side that takes this call and get the vcpu id and return it
in a register. 


#### TODO How to manage multiple hypercall?
